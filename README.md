# Roadmap - Front-End
This repository is to follow my evolution as a front-end.

I used this repository https://github.com/viniciusmazzeo/developer-roadmap as inspiration, to develop my front-end skills.
and created this https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H2Sa1_03rZ1u9aOF-vMRC0W5lG5l33Cywt0LkjJpiGg/edit?usp=sharing Google Sheets to follow this evolution, it lists the topics and what level I am in that topic.

The levels are:
- (0) Unknown
- (1) Newbie
- (2) Beginner
- (3) Padawan
- (4) Knight
- (5) Jedi

**The spreadsheet has an explanation for each level**
